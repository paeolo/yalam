> A Gulp-based incremental build system

### Feature Comparison

Here is a table comparing some javascript build systems:

| Feature         | Glupi         | Gulp  | Brunch |
| :-------------  |:-------------:|:-----:|:------:|
| opinionated     |               |       | âœ“      |
| incremental     | âœ“             |       | âœ“      |
| pipeline-based  | âœ“             | âœ“     | âœ“      |

### Architecture

Glupi is a Gulp-based incremental build system. It means it is primarly based on Gulp but with a minor difference to make it incremental. Thus the pipelines you are going to create with Glupi should be a bit different than the ones with Gulp, to make your build purely incremental.

Since Glupi is based on Glup, you should first read [this documentation](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start).
