> A Gulp-inspired incremental build system

### Feature Comparison

Here is a table comparing some javascript build systems:

| Feature         | Yalam         | Gulp  | Brunch |
| :-------------  |:-------------:|:-----:|:------:|
| opinionated     |               |       | âœ“      |
| incremental     | âœ“             |       | âœ“      |
| pipeline-based  | âœ“             | âœ“     | âœ“      |

### Architecture

Yalam is a Gulp-inspired incremental build system with some differences to make it incremental. Thus the pipelines you are going to create with Yalam should be a bit different than the ones with Gulp, to make your build purely incremental.

Since Yalam is inspired on Glup, you should first read [this documentation](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start).
